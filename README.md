I am your father!

Not like Darth Vader, more like the dude from The Family Guy. You know, the big fat guy in that catoon show for adults.
Yes, very much like him. He's not much of a father figure but it makes more since in this instance. Lol! I'm not saying I look like him in any way. Nope, I look more like Arnold Swartzenager with the big muscles and all!
